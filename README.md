# SetAsPrimary

**SetAsPrimary** gem helps to handle primary flag to your models very easily. You don't need to think too much about handling primary record, just include this module in your model and it will work fine.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'set_as_primary'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install set_as_primary

## Usage

In your Rails application, you might have models like EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Address, etc, which belong to User/Person model. There, you might need to set primary email address, primary phone number, or primary address for a user, and this gem will help you to handle that.

Examples:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :email_addresses
  has_many :phone_numbers
  has_many :addresses, as: :owner
end

class EmailAddress < ActiveRecord::Base
  include SetAsPrimary
  belongs_to :user

  set_as_primary :primary, owner_key: :user_id
end

class PhoneNumber < ActiveRecord::Base
  include SetAsPrimary
  belongs_to :owner, polymorphic: true

  set_as_primary :main, owner_key: :user_id
end

class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
  include SetAsPrimary
  belongs_to :owner, polymorphic: true

  set_as_primary :primary, polymorphic_key: :owner
end
``` 

You just need to include `SetAsPrimary` in your model where you want to handle primary flag. Then pass your primary flag with required association keys like `owner_key` or `polymorphic_key`  for  class helper method `set_as_primary`.

Default primary flag is `primary` and you can use another too (but make sure that that flag should be boolean type column).

If your model does not have primary key, then you can add it by running following command in your rails project.

```ssh
rails generate set_as_primary your-table-name
```
